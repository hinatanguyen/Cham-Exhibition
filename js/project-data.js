        description: "‘The Swing’ is a graphic novel focusing on a mom's childhood trauma, which lead to her overprotective behaviors towards her son. The story gently explores the complicated love between parents and children, especially in Vietnamese families shaped by helicopter parenting. Through the mother’s quiet voice and scattered memories, the story speaks to young adults who may feel both cared for and suffocated. The design uses soft visuals, pauses, and minimal text to reflect what often goes unsaid in families. It doesn’t try to judge or fix, but to open space for recognition and reflection. By showing one mother’s struggle, it invites readers to look at their own relationships and hopefully begin honest conversations with the people who raised them.",

The game aims to evoke a sense of childhood in players with a sense of hand-crafted appeal and activities a lot of people might have grown up doing, mostly being misbehaved. In addition this will be shown through the lens of the old infamous folklore story of “Ông Ba Bị” - the men lurking in the night kidnapping children who misbehave and eat them. This is a famous story a lot of parents tell their children for them not to misbehave. The game aims to retell this tale again for those who have grown up listening to it and to tell it again to those who have yet to hear it",

        description: "Vietnamese is characterized by a complex and intricate system of personal pronouns (Tôi, Anh, Con, Cháu, Ta, etc.) compared to many Western languages. Mastering these words is essential for day-to-day communication. This typographic project explores how these terms function in different family and social settings, investigating their role in shaping interactions, while informing those unaware about the roots and history of some of these words. The book employs the principle of a Dynamic Structure as a metaphor for how the use of personal pronouns is shaped by, and perpetuates structures in Vietnamese society such as age, status and formality. While the rules are rigid, these words still constantly change depending on the time, space and the relationships between people, and this is reflected in the work’s structure and typography. The book also borrows the format of an address book, an old tool to keep track of people’s contact information which fits the importance of addressing people by the right Vietnamese pronouns. ",
