        description: "‘The Swing’ is a graphic novel focusing on a mom's childhood trauma, which lead to her overprotective behaviors towards her son. The story gently explores the complicated love between parents and children, especially in Vietnamese families shaped by helicopter parenting. Through the mother’s quiet voice and scattered memories, the story speaks to young adults who may feel both cared for and suffocated. The design uses soft visuals, pauses, and minimal text to reflect what often goes unsaid in families. It doesn’t try to judge or fix, but to open space for recognition and reflection. By showing one mother’s struggle, it invites readers to look at their own relationships and hopefully begin honest conversations with the people who raised them.",
